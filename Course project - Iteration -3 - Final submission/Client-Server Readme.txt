Designed a the system in a server client form in a UML diagram because the directions did not explicitly stated to implement it it just said to design it as a server-client. This was the best idea I could come up with research and looking up on how to do client-servers, since I have not had networks yet and don't have a good grasp on the concept at all.

What I understand that the client side of the program would be creating a byte array message that would be sent to the server side to handle all of the aspects that deals with  the database. The client can have multiple open windows but they all converge to one server thus not creating multiple databases for the same system. All of the messages that the client creates have to be hardcoded in so the client knows what the message entirely is just by reading in the first byte of the array. Then the rest of the information, that is needed for the client to continue, is sent to the server all in byte form for the server to interpret go through the changes/updates in the databases needed or even pulling the correct information and then to send back to the client for the next message.
